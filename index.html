                <p>I was walking into lunch one day when Ellie gave me the idea for book. As soon as I heard it, I knew it was the one. This is TSITU.</p>

            <div id="ch1" class="chapter-content">
                <h2>Chapter One</h2>
                <p>The drive to Nephews’ Beach was supposed to be the start of a new me. For three hundred miles, I sat in the passenger seat of my mom’s aging Volvo, staring at my reflection in the mirror and squinting at all of the zits covering my face.</p>
                <p>But that was hard to do, especially around here. The humidity didn't make me look like a sea goddess, it made my hair expand horizontally like a lion.</p>
                <p>"Tabitha, honey, stop picking," my mother said, not looking away from the road.</p>
                <p>"I’m not picking," I lied, dropping my hand from the large blemish on my chin that I’d named 'Jerry.' "I’m just... assessing the damage."</p>
                <p>"You look ugly," she said, with the kind of tone where you tell she meant it. “You just need plastic surgery!"</p>
                <p>Sixteen was supposed to be the year where everything changed. I had grown 4 inches in 6 months, but I still felt like a rough draft of a person. After I got braces this year, I’ve been feeling worse and worse about my appearance, especially after my boyfriend of 6 or 7 years broke up with me out of the blue.</p>
                <p>The Guggenheim summer house sat on a cliff overlooking the Atlantic, a huge mansion that looked like it belonged in a postcard or something. We’ve been coming here since I was 5 years old. My mom and my aunt, Elena, had been best friends for years well before that.</p>
                <p>Elena was waiting on the porch, holding a glass of iced tea. She was perfect—skinny, tan, and smelled strongly of Sol De Janeiro. "Sarah! Tummy!" she called out, using the nickname I wanted her to forget.</p>
                <p>Sitting next to her was the one reason why I’d been so fixated on how I looked the past couple months. Conan.</p>
                <p>In my head, it would go like this: I’d step out of the car, my new sundress catching the breeze. Troye, the older one, would stop mid-sentence and his jaw would drop. The younger one, Conan, the “golden boy”, would shout with a grin, “Tummy, is that you?”</p>
                <p>The reality was the opposite. As I opened the car door, my foot got caught on my mom’s Ozempic bottle. I didn't just step out, I fell out. My feet flew above my head, and my brand new camera flew 8 feet away across the yard, and my face hit the gravel and I got a bloody nose. “Woah, you okay, Tummy?” He was already halfway down the stairs.</p>
                <p>At seventeen, Conan was the finest man I’ve ever seen. He had messy blonde hair, and had a smile that somehow always made you smile back. He reached out his hand to pick me up, and a jolt went through my body. That’s when I realized I was wet. My sweat stains were showing, and this was the worst time to find that out.</p>
                <p>"Hey, Conan," I croaked. My voice decided this was the perfect moment to crack.</p>
                <p>"You’re taller now!" he said, his eyes finally meeting mine. He didn't look horrified, but he did look slightly confused how I ended up like this. The year before, I’d been the girl everybody loved. Now, I’m the girl everybody pitied. Conan didn’t seem to care that my face looked like a pepperoni pizza with how much acne I had.</p>
                <p>Then there was Troye. He stayed on the porch, leaning against the railing. He didn't look like the Troye who had left for "Leadership Academy" last summer. That was the name the Guggenheims had used for the conversion camp his father had forced him into after finding those emails Troye had sent to a boy in his class.</p>
                <p>He had been gone for a year. I expected him to look different, maybe stronger, or at least older. But Troye just looked deflated. He was thinner, his skin a pale that could only be described as Edward Cullen. His messy dark curls that fell over his face were now in a buzz. He didn't wave, he just stood there with his hands in his pockets.</p>
                <p>"Hey, Troye," I called out. "Tabitha," he replied. He used my actual name, instead of the playful “Tummy” nickname he gave me. His voice was flat, devoid of any of the energy from the old Troye.</p>
                <p>No matter how ugly I looked, it was nothing compared to how “dead” he looked. I realized then that my problems were small compared to what he was going through internally. "Go on up and get settled, sweetie," Aunt Elena said, hugging me. “We have a seafood boil for dinner tonight!”</p>
                <p>She squeezed me tight and I felt more loved than I have in a while with my mom. She didn’t call me ugly! I grabbed my suitcase and hauled it up the stairs. The room was exactly as I remembered it: pale blue walls and the window that looked out at the dock.</p>
                <p>I dropped my bag and walked straight to the full-length mirror. I stood there for a long time, just looking. My arms were too long. My nose was too skinny. My braces showed every time I smiled, which wasn’t very often anymore because my smile would immediately fade as soon as I stared at myself in the mirror. I pulled my hair back, trying to see the "pretty" that was supposed to be there. I couldn’t find it.</p>
                <p>But as I stared at my own flaws, I kept seeing Troye’s eyes. They were so empty. Last summer, before everything happened, he had been the one who understood me. He was the one who taught me that you didn't have to be loud to be heard. Now, he was so quiet he was practically invisible.</p>
                <p>By sunset, the house was full of the sound of laughter and the smell of Old Bay seasoning. I changed into denim shorts and a baggy t-shirt, forgetting about the "sundress" plan. If I couldn't be pretty, I was going to be comfortable.</p>
                <p>Standing in the kitchen, I saw Conan down by the pool, playing with some of the girls from the neighbor’s house. He was the “golden boy” again, as if last year’s family trauma didn’t affect him at all. I stayed in front of the glass sliding doors until a voice startled me out of my thoughts. ”What are you doing?”</p>
                <p>I jumped. I hadn’t expected Troye to be here, in his armchair, a glass of water in his hand. He hadn’t touched the seafood. “Nothing.”</p>
                <p>“You’re hiding,” Troye said. It was the first bit of the old Troye I’d seen so far. “You think if you stay in the dark, people won’t notice your braces.”</p>
                <p>I feel heat rush up my neck. “Is it that obvious?”</p>
                <p>”Only because you’re holding your mouth shut every time you talk to someone,” he said, but there was no humor in it. “At least your ‘fix’ is temporary.”</p>
                <p>The weight of his words hung in the air. He wasn’t talking about my teeth. He was talking about the “fix” his parents forced on him: the counseling, the year of torture, the isolation…</p>
                <p>“Troye…” I started, but I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t have the vocabulary for talking to someone about a topic as serious as this.</p>
                <p>“Don’t,” he said, standing up now. “Don’t try to be nice, Tabitha. Just keep being the girl who’s obsessed with her own split ends. It’s easier for everyone."</p>
                <p>I didn't go back inside. I walked down to the dock instead. The wood was still warm from the sun, and the tide was coming in now. In the distance, I could start to see the lights of the town as it got darker. I remembered being ten years old, sitting in the exact same spot with Troye, and him telling me that the stars were just holes in the floor of heaven.</p>
                <p>Back then, I was just Tummy. He was just Troye. I looked down at my reflection in the water. I couldn't see the braces or the blemishes in the moonlight. I just saw a girl who felt like summer was already over, when it had really just started.</p>
                <p>I wasn’t the girl who turned pretty. Troye wasn’t the boy who came home. As Conan’s laughter echoed from the pool, I realized this summer wasn’t going to just be about romance or actually having fun. It was going to be about survival. It was the summer I turned ugly, but it was also the summer that I realized that being “pretty” was the least interesting thing about a person.</p>
                <p>I stared up at the stars again, wondering if Troye was looking at the same stars from his window, wondering if he still thought they were holes in heaven, or just cold, dead rocks in the dark.</p>
